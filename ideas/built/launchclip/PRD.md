Scored by: OpenClaw agent from Roger direction

| Criterion | Points | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Problem pain | 18/20 | Roger needs to pivot from shipping many OSS tools to consistently promoting them. |
| Demand signal | 16/20 | OSS maintainers and indie builders repeatedly need demo clips, captions, and social scheduling without a heavyweight marketing stack. |
| V1 buildability | 18/20 | Can start as a local-first orchestrator over repo facts, generated artifacts, captions, and dry-run queue receipts. |
| Differentiation | 13/15 | Focused on agent-built OSS promotion rather than generic social scheduling or generic video editing. |
| Agentic workflow leverage | 15/15 | Perfect agent workflow: inspect repo, produce evidence-backed demo assets, build edit plan, write captions, queue content. |
| Distribution potential | 8/10 | The tool promotes other tools, making every output a potential demo of the workflow itself. |

## Pitch

`launchclip` turns an OSS repo into a grounded social promo packet: demo artifacts, a short-form video edit plan, captions, and a product-videogen Review Feed submission that can later flow into Clutch Cut/social publishing after approval.

## Why It Matters

Roger's OSS factory can generate a lot of useful tools, but the next bottleneck is distribution. Each project needs proof that it works, a compelling demo angle, a short video, platform-specific captions, and a way to queue the content without manually stitching every step together.

The key is not to make another all-in-one video editor. The useful layer is an orchestration CLI and agent skill that coordinates existing local-first tools and emits reviewable artifacts before anything is posted.

## Qualification

### Pub Test

Can this be explained clearly in one sentence? Yes: "Run one command on an OSS repo and get a reviewable promo package with demo evidence, short-video plan, captions, and a queued social draft."

### Competitors / Adjacent Tools

- `video-skillkit` - already creates grounded video briefs and `video.json`; it should remain pre-production only.
- `cutpilot` - already handles local footage, EDLs, ffmpeg render plans, and optional local render execution.
- `tool-demo-script` - adjacent demo script/narration generator for CLI repos.
- `postmaker` - adjacent grounded social draft generator with explicit claim status.
- Remotion / Hyperframes-style renderers - good downstream adapters, but should not be hard-coded into the planning layer.
- Buffer, Hypefury, Typefully, Later, and native platform schedulers - useful scheduling references, but not local-first OSS-agent pipelines.
- `repo-to-content` - adjacent evidence-grounded launch content generator from repo facts.
- Clutch Cut - target queue and publishing system for Roger's content workflow.
- Product-videogen API - target review, generation, and approval lane. Existing Review Feed behavior is built around pending videos, carousels, and photos.

### Star / Demand Signal

- Personal workflow pain: Roger is moving from OSS production volume to promotion volume.
- Existing repo garden already includes pieces of the workflow: `video-skillkit`, `cutpilot`, `tool-demo-script`, `postmaker`, `pagepix`, and `ossrank`.
- Social distribution is the obvious next leverage point for local-first CLI projects: users need to see the problem, command, output, and install path quickly.

### Real Problem

OSS tools do not promote themselves. A maintainer or agent currently has to manually inspect a repo, choose a demo command, run it, capture output, write a video plan, render or hand off media, write captions, and queue posts. That manual chain is slow enough that promotion gets skipped.

### V1 Buildability

V1 can be built without external posting permissions:

- read a local repo
- generate deterministic demo artifacts
- call or emulate existing local tools where installed
- write `launchclip.json`, `brief.md`, `captions.md`, `queue.clutchcut.json`, and `REVIEW.md`
- support `--dry-run` by default
- require explicit approval/config before queue submission

## V1 Scope

- CLI command to inspect a repo and create a promotion workspace.
- Demo artifact stage:
  - choose a safe demo command from README/package scripts or accept `--demo-cmd`
  - run commands only with explicit allowlist/config
  - capture terminal output, screenshots, markdown snippets, and install commands
  - write provenance for every claim
- Video planning stage:
  - produce a `video-skillkit`-compatible manifest or consume an existing `video.json`
  - choose a format preset such as `short-15`, `short-30`, or `carousel`
  - emit a viral short structure: hook, proof, payoff, CTA
  - optionally hand off to `cutpilot` for local EDL/render planning when source footage exists
  - optionally emit renderer adapter inputs for Remotion or Hyperframes in later versions
- Caption stage:
  - generate platform-specific captions for X, LinkedIn, TikTok/Reels/Shorts, and Bluesky
  - include claim status and evidence links
  - include installation CTA and GitHub URL
  - keep editable drafts before queueing
- Review submission stage:
  - create a product-videogen Review Feed item with `approval_status=pending`
  - preserve the OSS repo, demo artifacts, captions, evidence, and launch metadata in `metadata_json` / `recipe_json`
  - support direct API submission only after explicit config/approval
  - keep Clutch Cut queueing behind product-videogen approval instead of bypassing the Review Feed
  - save request/response receipts with secrets redacted
- Agent skill:
  - clear workflow for agents to run inspect, create artifacts, review, render or dry-run, write captions, and queue
  - approval checkpoints before rendering final media or queueing externally

## Out of Scope

- Direct posting to social platforms in V1.
- Cloud rendering queues in V1.
- Full video editor UI.
- Replacing `video-skillkit`, `cutpilot`, or `postmaker`.
- Generating unsupported product claims.
- Using secrets or Clutch Cut credentials without explicit local config.
- Auto-publishing without human approval.

## CLI/API Sketch

```bash
launchclip init ./my-oss-tool --out .launchclip/my-oss-tool

launchclip demo ./my-oss-tool \
  --out .launchclip/my-oss-tool \
  --demo-cmd "npm run smoke" \
  --capture terminal

launchclip plan .launchclip/my-oss-tool \
  --format short-30 \
  --renderer none

launchclip captions .launchclip/my-oss-tool \
  --platforms x,linkedin,tiktok,bluesky

launchclip render .launchclip/my-oss-tool \
  --provider product-videogen \
  --dry-run

launchclip submit-review .launchclip/my-oss-tool \
  --provider product-videogen \
  --dry-run

launchclip review .launchclip/my-oss-tool
```

Example output:

```text
.launchclip/my-oss-tool/
  launchclip.json
  demo/
    terminal.txt
    command-receipt.json
    screenshot.png
  video/
    video.json
    brief.md
    render-plan.json
    product-videogen.dry-run.json
  captions/
    x.md
    linkedin.md
    tiktok.md
    bluesky.md
  review/
    product-videogen-review.dry-run.json
    product-videogen-review.receipt.json
    receipt.json
  REVIEW.md
```

## Orchestration Model

The CLI should behave like a small pipeline runner with explicit stage receipts:

1. `discover` - read repo metadata, README, package scripts, screenshots, and release docs.
2. `demo` - create or collect proof artifacts for a concrete tool workflow.
3. `brief` - call `video-skillkit` semantics to create a grounded video manifest.
4. `edit` - emit viral-format edit instructions and optionally call `cutpilot` or a renderer adapter.
5. `caption` - create platform drafts using only evidence-backed claims.
6. `render` - create a product-videogen request or local renderer plan; submit only when approved.
7. `submit-review` - create a product-videogen pending Review Feed item; dry-run by default.
8. `approval-handoff` - rely on product-videogen approval to enqueue/schedule social output.
9. `review` - produce one human-readable packet with claims, assets, captions, API requests, and product-videogen Review Feed status.

Each stage should be rerunnable and should read/write JSON so agents can inspect and patch artifacts between stages.

## Agent Skill Workflow

The skill should instruct agents to:

1. Identify the repo and target audience.
2. Run `launchclip init`.
3. Inspect suggested demo commands and ask before running non-trivial commands.
4. Run `launchclip demo` and verify artifacts.
5. Run `launchclip plan` to create a short-form structure.
6. Review claims against local evidence.
7. Run `launchclip captions`.
8. Run `launchclip submit-review --dry-run --provider product-videogen`.
9. Present `REVIEW.md` to Roger before product-videogen Review Feed submission, render, upload, queue submission, or posting.

## Renderer Strategy

`launchclip` should not own one renderer. It should define adapter contracts:

- `renderer: none` - planning only, default for V1.
- `renderer: cutpilot` - local footage and ffmpeg plan/render via `cutpilot`.
- `renderer: remotion` - future adapter that emits a Remotion project or composition props.
- `renderer: hyperframes` - future adapter that emits Hyperframes-compatible scene/frame input.

This keeps `video-skillkit` clean as the manifest/brief layer and lets rendering evolve independently.

## Product-Videogen Review Feed Strategy

Product-videogen should be the approval lane. `launchclip` should submit review-ready promo packets into product-videogen as pending review items rather than posting directly to Clutch Cut.

Current product-videogen behavior already supports the core lifecycle:

- Review Feed loads generated videos, carousels, and photos with `approval_status=pending`.
- `PATCH /api/videos/{id}` approves or rejects a pending video.
- Approval can sync the approved video into the social queue.
- The public API already exposes video generation, video listing, approval, and queue endpoints.

The API gap is clean ingestion for an external promo packet. V1 should add or use an endpoint shaped like:

```http
POST /api/v1/review-items
```

```json
{
  "content_type": "video",
  "source": "launchclip",
  "title": "runcard demo short",
  "approval_status": "pending",
  "video_url": "https://...",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://...",
  "duration_seconds": 30,
  "social_caption": "Evidence-backed draft caption...",
  "metadata_json": {
    "source_repo": "rogerchappel/runcard",
    "source_url": "https://github.com/rogerchappel/runcard",
    "platform_targets": ["x", "linkedin", "tiktok"],
    "launchclip_workspace": ".launchclip/runcard",
    "claim_status": "evidence_backed"
  },
  "recipe_json": {
    "source": "launchclip",
    "video_manifest": {},
    "demo_artifacts": [],
    "captions": {}
  }
}
```

Implementation options:

- Preferred: add a first-class public endpoint that creates a pending generated video/carousel/photo review record.
- Minimum viable: allow product-videogen generation endpoints to accept `source=launchclip`, `external_trace_id`, `caption`, and `metadata_json`, then return the generated item IDs for Review Feed tracking.
- Avoid: posting directly into Clutch Cut/social queue before product-videogen approval.

`launchclip submit-review --provider product-videogen --submit` should return:

```json
{
  "provider": "product-videogen",
  "review_item_id": "uuid",
  "review_url": "https://product-videogen.example/feed?tab=review",
  "approval_status": "pending",
  "submitted_at": "2026-06-10T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Clutch Cut Queue Strategy

Clutch Cut should remain downstream of product-videogen approval for this workflow. V1 may still write a local queue preview payload, but live queue insertion should happen through product-videogen's existing approval-to-social-queue path.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "launchclip.clutchcut.v1",
  "project": "my-oss-tool",
  "assets": [],
  "captions": [],
  "platforms": ["x", "linkedin", "tiktok"],
  "approvalRequired": true,
  "dryRun": true
}
```

Any direct Clutch Cut submission should require:

- a local config file naming the Clutch Cut endpoint or import folder
- explicit `--submit`
- a queue receipt saved to disk
- no hidden credentials in logs

## Product Videogen Strategy

The posting system should treat product-videogen as the media generation/render provider and the approval authority. Clutch Cut/social queue is the scheduling/publishing provider after approval.

Product-videogen requests should be built from the approved `video.json`, renderer settings, captions, and demo artifacts:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "launchclip.product-videogen.v1",
  "project": "my-oss-tool",
  "sourceManifest": "video/video.json",
  "format": "short-30",
  "assets": [],
  "captions": [],
  "approvalRequired": true,
  "dryRun": true
}
```

The adapter should support:

- `launchclip render --provider product-videogen --dry-run` to preview the request
- `launchclip render --provider product-videogen --submit` to create media after approval
- `launchclip submit-review --provider product-videogen --dry-run` to preview the Review Feed request
- `launchclip submit-review --provider product-videogen --submit` to create a pending Review Feed item
- storing returned asset IDs, URLs, thumbnails, durations, and provider job IDs
- storing the product-videogen review item ID and Review Feed URL
- retry-safe receipts so agents can resume without duplicate posts

The API integration should be narrow and swappable:

- `POST /render-jobs` or equivalent for product video generation
- `GET /render-jobs/:id` or equivalent for status
- `POST /api/v1/review-items` or equivalent for pending Review Feed insertion
- existing product-videogen approval endpoints for approval/rejection
- existing product-videogen social queue endpoints after approval
- optional local import folder mode for early development before stable APIs exist

## Verification

- Fixture repo produces deterministic `launchclip.json`, `video.json`, captions, queue payload, and `REVIEW.md`.
- Demo command allowlist prevents accidental network or publish commands.
- Captions include evidence or claim status for every product claim.
- Queue command defaults to dry-run and refuses to submit without explicit config plus `--submit`.
- Product-videogen command defaults to dry-run and refuses to submit without explicit config plus `--submit`.
- Product-videogen Review Feed submission creates or previews an `approval_status=pending` item.
- Clutch Cut/social queue handoff happens after product-videogen approval.
- Snapshot tests cover generated markdown and JSON.
- CLI tests cover rerunning individual stages.
- Adapter tests use fixture HTTP clients; no real API calls in CI.
- `npm run check`, `npm test`, `npm run smoke`, and `npm run package:smoke` pass.

## Agent Prompt

Build `launchclip`, a local-first TypeScript CLI and agent skill for turning OSS repositories into reviewable social promo packets.

The V1 should orchestrate demo artifact creation, short-form video planning, platform caption drafting, product-videogen render request generation, and product-videogen Review Feed submission. Keep external posting disabled by default. Write deterministic JSON and Markdown artifacts for every stage. Reuse the existing ecosystem boundaries: `video-skillkit` remains the grounded brief/manifest layer, `cutpilot` remains the local EDL/ffmpeg render path, `repo-to-content`/`postmaker` can inform evidence-backed copy, product-videogen handles media generation and approval, and Clutch Cut/social queue handles queueing/publishing after approval. Renderer adapters such as Remotion or Hyperframes stay optional future integrations. Include fixture-backed tests, a smoke command, release checks, and an agent skill that forces review before rendering, upload, Review Feed submission, queue submission, or posting.
