## Pitch

A tiny protocol and CLI for representing agent side effects as reviewable dry-run plans.

## Why It Matters

Before an agent emails, posts, creates tickets, or updates CRM, the human should see the exact intended action.

## V1 Scope

- JSON schema for action plans.
- CLI to validate and render human review summaries.
- Risk levels: read, draft, internal write, external write, public publish.
- Audit log format.

## Out of Scope

- Connector-specific execution.
- Hosted approval UI.

## CLI/API Sketch

```bash
action-dryrun validate plan.json
action-dryrun render plan.json --format markdown
```

## Verification

- Schema validation tests.
- Snapshot tests for rendered plans.

## Agent Prompt

Build `action-dryrun` as a reusable local protocol for safe agent action previews and audit logs.
